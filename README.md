# Control systems analysis

Programs to quickly and easily solve and analyse first and second order systems

Created by Sam Scott on 18/05/22

Includes:

Open loop control analysis:

- Step response
- Numerical Step info
- General second order system approximation (natural freq, damping ratio etc)
- Step info calculated from general second order equation soloutions
- DC gain calculation
- Poles and zeros
- Frequency response with bandwidth calculation


Closed loop control analysis:
- Above and
- PID controller input
- Sensitivity analysis.
